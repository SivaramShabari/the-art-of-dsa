# 🧠 DSA Chronicles in C# — Code, Chaos & Curiosity

> _“I don’t just solve problems, I **interrogate** them.”_

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms repo — built in **C#**, fueled by **curiosity**, and occasionally spiraling into **philosophical math rabbit holes**.  
This isn’t a grind. It’s a **quest.**

## 🚀 About This Repo

🎯 **Purpose:**  
To sharpen my algorithmic thinking, dive into elegant (and sometimes cursed) problem-solving patterns, and challenge myself — outside of job prep pressures.

👨‍💻 **Language:**  
All solutions are in pure, clean, and occasionally poetic **C#**.

🧩 **Problem Sources:**  
LeetCode, HackerRank, random whiteboard napkins, and midnight thoughts.

## 🧬 What Makes This Repo Cool?

✨ **Code Commentary** – Not just _what_, but the _why_ behind each line.  
🧠 **Deep Dives** – Sometimes I go full "math monk" on problems. You'll find mini-essays on optimization, edge cases, and theory.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- 💻 C# (.NET Core)
- 📝 Visual Studio + Rider
- 🔍 Debugging with LINQPad & unit tests
- 🎯 Occasionally Unity for visualizing data structures (yes, for fun!)

## 🧠 Why This Matters

I believe **algorithmic thinking** sharpens creativity.  
Not just for interviews — for life.  
Every bug is a riddle. Every runtime error is a plot twist.  
Welcome to the saga.

## 🔖 Bonus: Favorite Snippets

```csharp
// When elegance strikes
return nums.Aggregate((a, b) => a ^ b); // XOR magic: find unique element
```

```csharp
// When I overthink recursion
return Recurse(n, memo) ?? throw new ExistentialException("What even is 'n'?");
```
